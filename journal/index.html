                                    The article "Best Practices for Modals" makes many interesting points regarding the standards that should be pursued in UX design. The article brought to my attention that while modals were originally designed to simplify an interface, they developed into becoming the modern version of the unwanted pop-up, which users now instinctively try to close without a second thought. I learned that to prevent this frustration, we need to make sure the modal designs are user-initiated and always include a clear escape hatch, like an X in the top right or the escape key, so users don’t feel trapped.<br><br>

                                    I also learned that smaller details, like using a lightbox effect to darken the background, are really important for keeping the user focused on the task without losing their place on the original page. This is something I’ve always noticed when opening overlays, but was unsure how it operated. I now understand that it’s vital to follow these practices because if a modal is too large or overwhelming, it can disrupt the user flow. Even though some of the practices listed in the article seem simple, I understand that keeping them consistent among sites is very important to making the user’s journey feel simple or straightforward.<br><br>

                                    The article ‘Best practices for form design’ makes many valid points regarding the standards that should be pursued in UX design. I think these practices often go overlooked when looking at a website or app, but they create a large impact on how the user might interact with the interface. I learned that overall, when we create websites/interfaces, we need to keep in mind that the form must be extremely straightforward. Even though some of these practices may seem obvious, it is an important step to add all those elements in, maintaining consistency among other sites as well. <br><br>
                                    A website that I think exemplifies these best practices is Amazon, whether it’s from the log-in page or the checkout page. When creating a new account on the Amazon website, it utilizes practices such as multiple steps, easy questions, required fields, labels, placeholder text, and many more. It also surprises me how many elements are included in this website, just to streamline the user experience, giving a tangible experience that demonstrates how important many of the practices are.<br><br>
