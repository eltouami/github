                                    The image features a carefully posed action figure set against a custom background. What initially caught my attention was the deliberate staging; it moves beyond a simple "snapshot" of a figure and seems to be posed in a particular and specific way. The most obvious aspect is the figure itself, but the mysterious element lies in the relationship between the subject and the environment/background. It makes me wonder if this is a static tribute or a growing collection of figures. To go even further with the posing, I’d suggest experimenting with more extreme perspectives when taking pictures of the figure, such as a low-angle or using a fisheye lens to make the figure feel heroic and towering. Overall, my first impression of the image was that it is demonstrating one of many in a specific collection of objects or an interest in collecting and posing.<br><br>

                                    As of now, I’m most excited about the photo of my laptop stickers because it’s essentially a living visual of parts that make up my identity. While it looks like a collage of brands and art, every sticker has a specific backstory, from a design-a-thon to a sticker that represents my hometown in a subtle way. This image anchors my collection because it represents how I aim to curate my life in a portable way. I like to think of my laptop almost as my personal portable fridge; just as people use magnets to track their childhood, I use these stickers to mark where I’ve been and what shapes who I am. You can also see the passage of time in the physical condition of the stickers, such as the frayed edges of the older ones versus the shininess of the newer ones. To make this even more compelling, I want to play with Photoshop to create "focal points" by adding outlines or selective saturation to the stickers that represent my core identity. This would help the viewer navigate the visual noise and see the specific stories I’m aiming to tell.<br><br>

                                    The NYT article’s breakdown of "Visual Thinking Strategies" certainly resonates with me, especially the idea of treating an image like a detective case. I feel as if we often feel this pressure to make visuals perfectly represent exactly what’s being said, but the article argues that the most engaging images are the ones that make you question it at first. I agree with the point that the younger generation seem to want to just quickly find meaning rather than actually observing what’s being presented.<br><br>

                                    A website I found engaging and interesting was cinematypography.com (through Awwwards). It uses typography, grids, and interactions in a super cool way by starting with minimalist, black-and-white film title cards. The engaging part is the hover interaction: once you mouse over a title, the signature colors and atmospheric styling of the film fade in. It’s a cool example of a "reveal" that promotes interaction and learning.<br><br>

                                    A strength I noticed is how it bridges recognizable media with technical education, as clicking through lets you actually learn about the specific typography used in the film. However, a drawback to utilizing lots of media can be the performance load. As we’ve discussed in class, too many heavy images can slow down the load time, leading the user to be discouraged or disengaged. <br><br>

                                    The article "Best Practices for Modals" makes many interesting points regarding the standards that should be pursued in UX design. The article brought to my attention that while modals were originally designed to simplify an interface, they developed into becoming the modern version of the unwanted pop-up, which users now instinctively try to close without a second thought. I learned that to prevent this frustration, we need to make sure the modal designs are user-initiated and always include a clear escape hatch, like an X in the top right or the escape key, so users don’t feel trapped.<br><br>

                                    I also learned that smaller details, like using a lightbox effect to darken the background, are really important for keeping the user focused on the task without losing their place on the original page. This is something I’ve always noticed when opening overlays, but was unsure how it operated. I now understand that it’s vital to follow these practices because if a modal is too large or overwhelming, it can disrupt the user flow. Even though some of the practices listed in the article seem simple, I understand that keeping them consistent among sites is very important to making the user’s journey feel simple or straightforward.<br><br>

                                    The article ‘Best practices for form design’ makes many valid points regarding the standards that should be pursued in UX design. I think these practices often go overlooked when looking at a website or app, but they create a large impact on how the user might interact with the interface. I learned that overall, when we create websites/interfaces, we need to keep in mind that the form must be extremely straightforward. Even though some of these practices may seem obvious, it is an important step to add all those elements in, maintaining consistency among other sites as well. <br><br>
                                    A website that I think exemplifies these best practices is Amazon, whether it’s from the log-in page or the checkout page. When creating a new account on the Amazon website, it utilizes practices such as multiple steps, easy questions, required fields, labels, placeholder text, and many more. It also surprises me how many elements are included in this website, just to streamline the user experience, giving a tangible experience that demonstrates how important many of the practices are.<br><br>
